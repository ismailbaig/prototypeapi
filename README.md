Prototype API

Mock Data is just placed, but the API is calling the real time MONGO DB for data retrieval.

3 APIs created with end points ending with task1, task2, task3

HOW TO RUN:
----------
In DEV Environment:
1. OPEN Node Command prompt.
2. Type 'node alltasks.js'
       This will run the API at the PORT 4000!


To Check only API:
------------------
1. Install POSTMAN 
2. Open POSTMAN and call a GET http verb method, e.g localhost:4000/task1
